# myPracticeCodes
This is where I keep all my working codes (optimized or not). This is also my first github repository (so chances are that something may go wrong :))

myScrapingDemo-2 ipython notebook contains my attempt to learn webscraping following Harvard CS-109 course. I have done more analysis than what the class showed in their demonstration of webscraping. 

primes_less_than.py code is not my original. I wrote another version which is more memory consuming. This code is copied and rewrote so that I can understand the implementation. 

I am soon going to add new files.
