# myPracticeCodes
This is where I keep all my working codes (optimized or not). This is also my first github repository (so chances are that something may go wrong :))

myScrapingDemo-2 ipython notebook contains my attempt to learn webscraping following Harvard CS-109 course. I have done more analysis than what the class showed in their demonstration of webscraping. 


I am soon going to add new files.
